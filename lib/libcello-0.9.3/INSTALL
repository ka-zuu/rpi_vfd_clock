Install
=======


Installing from Source
----------------------

One can build the source distribution via the standard method:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install


Running the tests
-----------------

Once the library is installed one can run the tests as follows

    $ make check


Setting up the Build Environment
--------------------------------

One can run `bootstrap.sh` or setup autotools manually using the following.

The build environment requires autotools and can be setup like this:

    $ autoreconf -i
    $ ./configure
    $ make

If autoreconf throws any warnings or errors then follow the instructions which it gives.

* It may complain about missing files or scripts. If it does that run `automake --add-missing` as suggested. 
* It may complain about not being able to find `ltmail.sh`. In this case run `libtoolize` or on OS X `glibtoolize`
